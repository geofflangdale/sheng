# sheng
A small DFA for under 16 states, designed to execute around the 1 cycle per byte level at all times.

This is adapted from a similarly-named engine used in the Hyperscan regular expression matcher (https://github.com/intel/hyperscan) but is presented here as a standalone project for clarity.
